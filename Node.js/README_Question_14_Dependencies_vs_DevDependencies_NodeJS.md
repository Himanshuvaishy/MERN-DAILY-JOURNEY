# ✅ 14. What is the Difference Between `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in Node.js?

---

### 🔹 1. What (Simple Definition)

- **`dependencies`** are the packages your **application needs to run** in production.
- **`devDependencies`** are the packages needed **only during development**.

> These are declared in your `package.json` file under their respective keys.

---

### 🔹 2. Why (Purpose / Importance)

Separating dependencies helps:
- Keep **production builds lightweight**
- Avoid **security issues** by excluding dev-only tools
- Make deployment and CI/CD pipelines **faster and safer**

---

### 🔹 3. How (Detailed Usage)

#### ✅ `dependencies`

Used by your app at **runtime** (when the app runs).

Install using:
```bash
npm install <package-name>
   
   "dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.18.2",
  "mongoose": "^7.0.4"


✅ devDependencies
Used only in development (testing, building, linting, etc.)

Install using:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install <package-name> --save-dev
Example:

json
Copy
Edit
"devDependencies": {
  "nodemon": "^3.0.1",
  "eslint": "^8.45.0"

🔹 4. Real-World Analogy
dependencies = tools you carry with you on a trip (you need them all the time).

devDependencies = tools you use only while packing (you leave them at home).

🔹 5. Interview-Ready Summary
Feature	dependencies	devDependencies
When used	Runtime	Development time only
Installed on	Both npm install and deployment	Only with full install
Examples	express, mongoose	nodemon, eslint, jest
Install command	npm install	npm install --save-dev

💡 Tip
Use this command to exclude devDependencies in production:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install --production
⚠️ Trap
Don’t put runtime-required packages in devDependencies, or your app may crash in production.
