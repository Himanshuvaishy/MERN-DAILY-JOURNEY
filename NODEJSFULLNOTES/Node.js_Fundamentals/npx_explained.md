# ⚡ Understanding `npx`

`npx` is a **package runner tool** that comes with `npm` (since v5.2.0).  
At the end of the day, **`npx` is just a way to execute Node.js binaries from npm packages** without needing to install them globally.

---

## 🔹 Why do we need `npx`?

Normally:
```bash
npm install -g create-react-app
create-react-app my-app
```
❌ Problem: This pollutes your global system and may cause version conflicts.

With `npx`:
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```
✅ No need to install globally — it fetches and runs it directly.

## 🔹 How `npx` Works (Step by Step)

When you run a command like:
```bash
npx cowsay "Hello Himanshu"
```

1. **Check Local `node_modules/.bin`**  
   - `npx` first checks if the package exists in your project’s `node_modules/.bin`.  
   - If yes, it runs that version (local project dependency).

2. **Check Global Packages**  
   - If not found locally, it checks if the package is installed globally.

3. **Temporary Download (if not installed)**  
   - If still not found, `npx` downloads the package temporarily from npm registry.  
   - Runs it immediately.  
   - After execution, it may delete the temporary copy (depending on config).

4. **Execute the Binary**  
   - Runs the package’s CLI entry (from its `bin` field in `package.json`).  
   - Example: `cowsay` runs a script that prints ASCII cows.

## 🔹 Example Use Cases

### 1. Run a package without global install
```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

### 2. Run a specific version of a package
```bash
npx cowsay@1.4.0 "Old version"
```

### 3. Run local project binaries
```bash
npx eslint .
```
👉 No need to install eslint globally.

### 4. Execute GitHub Gists or remote code
```bash
npx github:username/repo
```

## 🔹 At the End of the Day — What is `npx`?

👉 **`npx` is just a convenient runner for npm packages**.  
It makes sure you always use the **right version** of a CLI tool without polluting your global system.

You can think of it as:
- `npm` → installs packages.  
- `npx` → executes packages.  

---

## ✅ Summary

- `npx` comes bundled with `npm`.  
- Runs local, global, or temporary npm binaries.  
- Saves you from unnecessary global installs.  
- Ensures reproducibility by using the exact version in your project.
