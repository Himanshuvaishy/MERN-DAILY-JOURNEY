## ðŸ”¹ Practical Uses of Buffers

### 1. File Handling
- Reading and writing **binary files** (images, PDFs, videos, executables).  
- Example: Copying a file.
```js
const fs = require("fs");
const data = fs.readFileSync("photo.png"); // returns Buffer
fs.writeFileSync("copy.png", data);
2. Networking
Handling raw TCP/UDP packets, HTTP requests/responses, and WebSocket frames.

Buffers ensure correct byte-level control when sending/receiving data.

js
Copy code
const net = require("net");
const server = net.createServer(socket => {
  socket.on("data", chunk => {
    console.log("Received:", chunk); // Buffer
  });
});
server.listen(4000);
3. Streaming Large Data
Buffers + Streams allow processing of huge files (e.g., 1GB video) in small chunks instead of loading the whole file in memory.

js
Copy code
const fs = require("fs");
fs.createReadStream("big.mp4").on("data", chunk => {
  console.log("Chunk size:", chunk.length);
});
4. Cryptography
Hashing, encryption, and encoding require binary-safe operations.

js
Copy code
const crypto = require("crypto");
const hash = crypto.createHash("sha256");
hash.update(Buffer.from("password"));
console.log(hash.digest("hex"));
5. Working with Encodings
Convert between UTF-8, Base64, Hex, etc.

js
Copy code
const buf = Buffer.from("Hello");
console.log(buf.toString("base64")); // SGVsbG8=
6. Custom Binary Protocols / IoT
Buffers parse and construct binary packets for IoT devices, game servers, and custom communication protocols.

ðŸ”¹ Limitations of Buffers
Fixed Size

Once allocated, a Bufferâ€™s size cannot be changed.

Need to create a new Buffer for resizing.

Memory Cost

Large Buffers consume significant memory.

Using Buffer.allocUnsafe() risks leaking old memory contents if not overwritten.

Not Human-Readable

Buffers are raw bytes, so debugging is harder compared to strings or objects.

Need conversion (toString(), toJSON()) to inspect.

Encoding Complexity

UTF-8 and multi-byte characters require careful handling.

Naive slicing or concatenation may corrupt data.

Better Alternatives for Large Data

Buffers are great for chunks, but for continuous data (videos, logs, uploads) â†’ use Streams.

Streams handle backpressure and memory efficiency better.

âœ… Summary
Buffers are essential for binary data handling in Node.js (files, networking, crypto, streams).

But they come with limitations (fixed size, memory-heavy, encoding complexity).

Use Buffers for chunks of binary data.

Use Streams when dealing with large, continuous data flows.
