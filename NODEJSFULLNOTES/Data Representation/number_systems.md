# Number Systems in Computing

In computing, data is represented using **different number systems**. The most common ones are:
- Decimal (Base 10)
- Binary (Base 2)
- Octal (Base 8)
- Hexadecimal (Base 16)

## 1. Decimal Number System (Base 10)
- The decimal system is what we use in daily life.
- It has **10 digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9**.
- Each digit’s position has a **place value** that is a power of 10.
- Example:  
  - 345 = (3 × 10²) + (4 × 10¹) + (5 × 10⁰)  
  - = 300 + 40 + 5

## 2. Binary Number System (Base 2)
- Used **inside computers** because they work with ON/OFF states.
- It has **2 digits: 0 and 1**.
- Each digit’s position has a **place value** that is a power of 2.
- Example:  
  - 1011 (binary) = (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰)  
  - = 8 + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 (decimal)

## 3. Octal Number System (Base 8)
- Uses **8 digits: 0 to 7**.
- Each digit’s position has a **place value** that is a power of 8.
- Example:  
  - 157 (octal) = (1 × 8²) + (5 × 8¹) + (7 × 8⁰)  
  - = 64 + 40 + 7 = 111 (decimal)

---

## 4. Hexadecimal Number System (Base 16)
- Uses **16 symbols**:  
  - Digits **0–9** and letters **A–F** (where A=10, B=11, …, F=15).
- Each digit’s position has a **place value** that is a power of 16.
- Example:  
  - 2F (hex) = (2 × 16¹) + (15 × 16⁰)  
  - = 32 + 15 = 47 (decimal)

# 🔑 Summary
- **Decimal (10 digits)** → Human use.  
- **Binary (2 digits)** → Computers use internally.  
- **Octal (8 digits)** → Compact binary representation.  
- **Hexadecimal (16 digits)** → Widely used in programming and memory addresses.
