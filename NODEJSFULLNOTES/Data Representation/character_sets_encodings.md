# ðŸ”¤ Character Sets vs Character Encodings (ASCII and Unicode)

## ðŸ”¹ 1. Character Set (What characters exist?)
A **Character Set** is a collection of characters (letters, digits, symbols) that a computer can understand.

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as the **alphabet** for a language.  

Examples:
- **ASCII Character Set** â†’ A-Z, a-z, 0-9, basic symbols like `! @ # $ % ^ & *`.
- **Unicode Character Set** â†’ Covers **all languages** (English, Hindi, Chinese, Emojis, etc.).

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Character Encoding (How characters are stored in binary?)
A **Character Encoding** tells the computer **how to represent each character as binary (0s and 1s)**.  

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it as the **mapping/rules** for converting characters into binary.

---

## ðŸ”¹ ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)
- One of the earliest **character sets + encoding**.  
- Uses **7 bits** (128 characters).  
- Covers:  
  - Aâ€“Z â†’ `65â€“90`  
  - aâ€“z â†’ `97â€“122`  
  - Digits `0â€“9` â†’ `48â€“57`  
  - Symbols â†’ `!` = 33, `@` = 64, etc.  

### Example:
```
'A' â†’ 65 â†’ 01000001 (binary)
'B' â†’ 66 â†’ 01000010 (binary)
```

âœ… Good for **English only**, but limited.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Unicode
- A **universal character set** that covers **all languages and symbols**.  
- Supports emojis, scripts like Devanagari (Hindi), Arabic, Chinese, etc.  
- Each character has a **unique code point** (e.g., U+0041 = 'A').  

### Encodings of Unicode:
1. **UTF-8** (most common, web standard)  
   - Variable length (1â€“4 bytes per character).  
   - Backward-compatible with ASCII.  
   - Efficient storage for English text.  

2. **UTF-16**  
   - Uses 2 or 4 bytes.  
   - Efficient for Asian languages.  

3. **UTF-32**  
   - Always 4 bytes.  
   - Simple but memory-heavy.

### Example:
```
'A' â†’ U+0041 â†’ 01000001 (UTF-8: 1 byte)
'à¤¹' (Hindi) â†’ U+0939 â†’ UTF-8: 3 bytes
'ðŸ˜Š' â†’ U+1F60A â†’ UTF-8: 4 bytes
```

## âœ… Character Set vs Encoding Analogy

- **Character Set** â†’ "Dictionary" (What characters exist?)  
- **Character Encoding** â†’ "Translator" (How to write them in binary?)  

### Example:
- Unicode says: "Thereâ€™s a character called 'ðŸ˜Š' with code point U+1F60A".  
- UTF-8 says: "Store it as `11110000 10011111 10011000 10101010` (4 bytes)".

## âœ… Summary

| Term               | Meaning                                    | Example |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| **Character Set**  | List of possible characters                | ASCII (128 chars), Unicode (>143,000 chars) |
| **Character Encoding** | How those characters are stored in binary | ASCII (1 byte), UTF-8 (1â€“4 bytes), UTF-16, UTF-32 |
| **ASCII**          | Old standard, 128 chars, English only      | 'A' = 65 |
| **Unicode**        | Universal, supports all languages + emojis | 'ðŸ˜Š' = U+1F60A |

ðŸ‘‰ In short:  
- **Character Set** = Which characters exist?  
- **Character Encoding** = How are they stored in binary?
