# Shebang and Its Importance in Running Node.js Modules

## What is Shebang?
- Shebang is a special sequence of characters `#!` placed at the very first line of a script file.
- It instructs the operating system about which interpreter to use to run the script.
- Example of a shebang line:
```

\#!/bin/bash

```
This means the script will be run by the Bash shell.

## Why is Shebang Important in Node.js?
- For Node.js scripts, the common shebang line is:
```

\#!/usr/bin/env node

```
- This tells the system to find the `node` interpreter in the user's environment path and use it to run the script.
- It allows a Node.js script to be executed directly from the command line like an executable file.
- Without the shebang, one must run the script by prefixing it with `node`, like `node script.js`.
- Using `#!/usr/bin/env node` makes the script portable across different systems where Node might be installed in different locations.

## Example Usage
Create a file named `app.js`:
```

\#!/usr/bin/env node
console.log("Hello from Node shebang!");

```
Make the script executable:
```

chmod +x app.js

```
Run it directly:
```

./app.js

```
Output:
```

Hello from Node shebang!

```

## Benefits of Using Shebang in Node Modules
- Simplifies running Node scripts from the command line.
- Useful when creating CLI tools or standalone commands.
- Ensures the appropriate Node interpreter is used.
- Avoids manually typing `node` before the script name.
